# TerminalRacing

## Overview

**TerminalRacing** is a 2D vehicle fluid simulation game designed for the command line. This project combines the excitement of vehicle racing with the complexity of fluid dynamics, providing a unique and engaging gaming experience directly from your terminal.

**Please Note:** TerminalRacing is currently under development and is not yet fully functional. Some features may be incomplete or not working as intended. Contributions and feedback are welcome to help bring this project to completion.

## Features (Planned)

- **Realistic Vehicle Physics**: Enjoy a simulation that takes into account various physical properties of vehicles and fluids to create a realistic racing environment.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Play the game directly from your terminal, no graphical interface required.
- **2D Simulation**: Experience the simplicity and fun of 2D racing combined with the challenge of fluid dynamics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run TerminalRacing, you'll need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TerminalRacing.git
    cd TerminalRacing
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Game

**Please Note:** As TerminalRacing is still under development, running the game may not produce a fully functional experience.

To start the game, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to control your vehicle and navigate through the racing track.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of your vehicle.
- Avoid obstacles and try to complete the track as quickly as possible.
- The simulation will account for fluid dynamics, making the controls more challenging and realistic.

## Code Structure

- **main.py**: The entry point of the game. Handles user input and game loop.
- **vehicle.py**: Contains the Vehicle class, which defines the properties and behaviors of the racing vehicle.
- **track.py**: Manages the race track layout and obstacles.
- **fluid.py**: Simulates the fluid dynamics affecting the vehicle.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions used throughout the project.
